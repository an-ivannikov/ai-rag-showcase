# MythLang Introduction

MythLang is a fictional programming language designed for creating magical spells and rituals.

It is based on three main principles:
1. **Clarity** — spells must be easy to read and understand.
2. **Safety** — avoid unstable rituals unless explicitly marked.
3. **Power** — allow developers to channel high-level magical energy.

MythLang files use the `.myth` extension.
